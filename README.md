# Single_Phase_Grid_Connected_PV_Inverter

This repository contains the code and supporting resources for a research project focused on the design and control of a **Single-Phase Grid Connected PV Solar Inverter**.

## 🔬 Research Overview

This project explores a single-stage inverter topology designed for grid-connected photovoltaic (PV) systems. It aims to address key challenges in control, synchronization, and power quality in grid-tied solar applications.

The system is implemented on the **TMS320F28379D** microcontroller platform, incorporating advanced control algorithms and real-time signal processing techniques.

## ⚙️ Features

- Embedded control using **C2000 MCU (F28379D)**
- Real-time data acquisition and PWM generation
- Grid synchronization using a phase-locked loop (PLL)
- Modular structure for future upgrades
